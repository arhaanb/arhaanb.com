The website is Statically Generated and uses Client-Side Routing to give the website a smooth experience.

The website also has a realtime indicator of what song I'm currently playing on Spotify, and my top 5 songs of the month. This was possible using [Vercel](https://vercel.com)'s Serverless Functions and the Spotify API.
