	<h5 class="smltitle">About this website</h5>

	<p>
		My main motive for this website was to showcase the projects I've built over
		the last few years. My website has always been a playground for me to try
		out new tech and experiment new features.

		for Static Site Generation to make this website load faster. It's been
		deployed to <a href="//vercel.com" target="_blank">Vercel</a> and it also
		takes advantage of it's serverless functions for link shortening at
