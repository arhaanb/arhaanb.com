			>About this website</a
		>
	</h5>

	<p>
		My main motive for this website was to showcase the projects I've built over
		the last few years. My website has always been a playground for me to try
		out new tech and experiment with new features. This website is written in
		Vue 3 and Vite and it uses the
		<a href="//github.com/antfu/vite-ssg" target="_blank">vite-ssg</a> package
		for Static Site Generation.
	</p>
	<p>
		It's been deployed to
		<a href="//vercel.com" target="_blank">Vercel</a> and it takes advantage of
		it's serverless functions for features like the realtime Spotify currently
		playing indicator and contact form. This website is Open Sourced at
		<a href="//github.com/arhaanb/website" target="_blank"
			>github.com/<wbr />arhaanb/<wbr />website</a
		>. Leave a star!
